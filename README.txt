STUDENT PLACEMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT

PROJECT TITLE: 
Student Placement Prediction and Clustering using Machine Learning

 NOTEBOOK FILE:
student_placement_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing complete code

 OBJECTIVE:
• Analyze student data for placement readiness
• Group students into clusters based on skills and academics
• Provide personalized recommendations

 REQUIREMENTS:
• Python 3.x
• Jupyter Notebook
• pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

 HOW TO RUN:
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

3. Open and run:
   student_placement_analysis.ipynb

4. Run all cells sequentially

 EXPECTED OUTPUT:
• Student clusters with analysis
• Visualization graphs and charts
• Placement readiness recommendations
• CSV files with results

 GENERATED FILES:
• college_student_placement_dataset.csv - Original dataset
• student_clusters_results.csv - Student clusters results
• student_placement_analysis.ipynb - Main Jupyter Notebook
• clustering_visualization.png - Clustering visualization graph
• Additional_clustering_visualization.png - Additional clustering visualization graph
